# Volleyball Auto Reserve

This is a Selenium-based project designed to automate the process of reserving volleyball drop-in spots. The problem this project addresses is the difficulty of reserving spots in a timely manner, especially when spots fill up almost instantly. Often, when I'm available to book, I can only secure a spot for myself, leaving no room for my girlfriend. This automation tool aims to ensure that both of us can reserve spots, even when time is tight.

## Features

- Automates the process of reserving a volleyball spot.
- Provides a fast and efficient solution to secure spots before they fill up.
- Helps when you're unavailable to manually book or are only able to book for one person.
